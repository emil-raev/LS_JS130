What is hoisting?

How do var, let, and const interact with hoisting? How do they differ?
How do functions and classes interact with hoisting? How do they differ?
What part does hoisting play in the way a specific program works?



#  What is hoisting? What part does hoisting play in the way a specific program works?

JavaScript engines operate in two main phases: a creation phase and an execution phase. The creation phase prepares the code for execution. Each variable, function, or class declaration, are added to their respective scope. Because of the creation phase and JS knowledge of all variables, when the code actually runs during the execution phase, it appears as if the variable declarations were 'moved'/hoisted to the top of their respective scope.

#  How do var, let, and const interact with hoisting? How do they differ?

When hoisting `let` declarations, JavaScript defines the name, but it doesn't set the variable to an initial value. Uninitialized variables like this one are said to be in the Temporal Dead Zone.

`var` variables get hoisted to the top of the function and JavaScript assigns the value `undefined`

#  How do functions and classes interact with hoisting? How do they differ?

 JavaScript hoists each function declaration to the top of the enclosing function (above the variables), including the function's definition.  Function hoisting has undefined behavior when the function is nested inside a non-function block.

 JavaScript also hoists class declarations. It hoists the name, but doesn't initialize it (TDZ).
    
  
#  What is strict mode? How does it differ from sloppy mode?

Is an optional mode that modifies the semantics of JavaScript and prevents certain kinds of errors and syntax.
- Strict eliminates some silent errors that occur in sloppy mode by changing them so that they throw errors instead
- Strict prevents some code that can inhibit JavaScript's ability to optimize a program
- Strict mode prohibits using names and syntax that may conflict with future versions of JavaScript.

#  How do you enable strict mode at the global or function level?

The "use strict" statement is an example of a pragma, a language construct that tells a compiler, interpreter, or other translator to process the code in a different way. Auto in classes and modules. Can't disable it. Strict mode is lexically scoped.

#  Describe how code behaves under both strict and sloppy mode.

- Strict mode sets the implicit execution context to `undefined` instead of the global object. 
- Will raise an error if you try to assign a value to a variable that hasn't been declared. Forgetting to use this in a method raises an error.
- Prevents numbers with leading zeros

#  When should you use (or not use) strict mode?

Use strict mode in any new code that you write. If you're adding new functions to an old codebase, it's safe to use function-level strict mode in the new functions, and you probably should do so. However, if you're not creating a new function in that old codebase, you probably shouldn't try to use strict mode. 

#  What is a closure?

"the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was [defined]

#  When is a closure created?

Closures are created when you define a function or method. The closure essentially closes over its environment -- what's in scope.

#  What is the relationship between closures and scope?

Closures use the scope in effect at a function's definition point to determine what variables that function can access.  Looking at outer scopes until you reach the global scope all happens when the closure is defined.

#  What do we mean when we say that closures are defined lexically?

A closure includes all the variables that are in scope where you defined the function. Those variables may not be in scope when you invoke the function, but they're still available to the function. Even if you never call a particular function, that function forms a closure with its surrounding scope.

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function() {
    counter++;
    return counter;
  }
}
let incrementCounter = makeCounter();
```

#  What is partial function application?

 Partial function application refers to the creation of a function that can call a second function with fewer arguments than the second function expects. The created function applies the remaining arguments.

 # Why do we need private data?

  Using closures to restrict data access is an excellent way to force other developers to use the intended interface, helps protect data integrity.
  Private data also helps prevent the user of an object from becoming dependent on the implementation. 
  
#  What are IIFEs?

An IIFE or immediately invoked function expression is a function that you define and invoke simultaneously

#  How do you use them?
#  How do you use IIFEs to create private scopes?

Anonymous IIFE creates a private scope; How you can use scope to prevent some code from making accidental changes to variables in its outer scope.

#  How do you use blocks to create private scopes?

In ES6 JavaScript and later, you can use blocks to create private scopes.

#  How do you use IIFEs to create private data?

When we discuss private data, we're talking about encapsulation: making local data inaccessible from the code's outer scope.

```javascript
const makeUniqueId = (function() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    ++count;
    return count;
  };
})();
```

#  The benefits of using modules.
#  How to use and create CommonJS modules.
#  How CommonJS modules pass exported items to the importing module.
  
#  What are exceptions?
#  Given an exception error message, identify the exception type and understand the meaning.
#  Understand the terms raise, throw, re-throw, and catch.
#  Know the syntax for the throw and try/catch statements.
#  Understand the program flow for an exception.

 encapsulation: we should hide implementation details from users of the class
